㊂7️⃣️🔖️ V7Tags (a numeronym for VerboseTags) is an experimental verbose tagging system for a semantic web, that contains a tag for every single aspect of the media it represents. This can result in a 10 second video having tens/hundreds of thousands of tags. This is the official source repository for V7Tags.
